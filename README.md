## 🚀 How ClientScout AI Works

### 1️⃣ AI Query Generation
ClientScout AI intelligently generates 3–5 Google Maps search queries based on your sector and location.

AI may generate:
- dermatologists
- skin clinics
- cosmetic dermatology
- dermatology specialists

### 2️⃣ Google Maps Discovery
Each query searches Google Maps and extracts **real, verified businesses**, not scraped lists or outdated databases.

---
